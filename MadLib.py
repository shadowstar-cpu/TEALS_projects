#It was a “adjective1” and “adjective2” night, “propernoun1” was “verbprt1” at the “place”.
#Suddenly a “adjective3” “noun2” jumped out and “verbpst1” “propernoun1” “ “interjection” ” “propernoun1” shouted.
#“HAHA I “verbpst1” you!” shouted “noun2”. “Noun2” “verbprt2” into the night, never to be seen again.
#“Propernoun1” was too “adjective4” to speak. He went back to his “typeofhouse” to rest after a “adjective5” night
